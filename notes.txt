🔢 1️⃣ Load & Preprocess RFM Data
loaded customer transaction data.

calculated sRFM scores:

Recency = days since last purchase.

Frequency = number of purchases.

Monetary = total spent.

📏 2️⃣ Scaled RFM Scores
used MinMaxScaler to normalize Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.

important for fair clustering.

🧠 3️⃣ Applied KMeans Clustering
tried different values of K.

found best using Elbow Method & Silhouette Score.

final model: KMeans with 4 clusters.

🏷 4️⃣ Clustered Customers
used fitted KMeans to assign each customer a Cluster Label.

added it to the main RFM DataFrame.

📊 5️⃣ Interpreted Clusters
analyzed the cluster centers.

labeled them manually as:

High-Value

Regular

At-Risk

Occasional

🥧 6️⃣ Visualized Segments
created a colorful Pie Chart to show % of customers in each segment.

very helpful for business insights 👀

💾 7️⃣ Saved Best Model
saved trained KMeans model as .pkl using joblib.dump().

this lets us use it in Streamlit or other apps.


🧠 RFM = Recency, Frequency, Monetary
Metric	What it means 💭	How we calculate 🧮
Recency	How recently a customer bought something	Days between last purchase and today/snapshot
Frequency	How often a customer purchased	Number of unique invoices (orders)
Monetary	How much money a customer spent in total 💸	Sum of all (Quantity × UnitPrice)

What You Should Cover for K-Means Clustering Seminar:
✨ 1. What is Clustering?
Grouping similar data points together ✨

Unsupervised Learning (no labels)

Like putting friends into different groups based on vibe 💕

✨ 2. What is K-Means?
“K” = number of clusters

Algorithm:

Choose k random centroids

Assign points to nearest centroid

Move centroids to center of assigned points

Repeat till stable

🎯 Goal: minimize inertia (distance within clusters)

✨ 3. How to choose K?
Use the Elbow Method

Plot k vs inertia (distortion)

Look for the bend/elbow

After elbow = diminishing returns 😐

(you can even show the graph 📈 you created)

✨ 4. Real Example - RFM Clustering (your project! 💕)
Feature	Meaning
Recency	Days since last purchase
Frequency	How many purchases
Monetary	How much spent ₹

📌 You used KMeans to segment customers into:

🟢 High-Value

🔴 At-Risk

💛 Occasional

🧡 Regular

✨ 5. How You Visualize It
2D scatter plot (Recency vs Monetary)

3D cluster plot (RFM together)

Pie chart of segment distribution

✨ 6. Why it Matters?

💖 Bonus Lines if Nervous:
“Even though it’s unsupervised, K-Means finds surprising structure in data.”

“Elbow method helped us find that 4 clusters give balance of simplicity and insight.”

“It’s a simple yet powerful tool for segmentation.”
